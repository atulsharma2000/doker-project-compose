# doker-project-compose


𝑨𝒊𝒎:  Project that can run multiple containers as a single service. It supports Wordpress, Django, Joomla, Drupal, and capable of launching these with all infrastructure using MySQL or PostgreSQL databases and Apache or Ngnix web servers.

𝑻𝒆𝒄𝒉 𝒏 𝑻𝒐𝒐𝒍: OS-level virtualization, Docker and Docker-compose, RHEL8.

𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒋𝒆𝒄𝒕 𝑫𝒆𝒔𝒄𝒓𝒊𝒑𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏:  Using python I created a terminal user interface, where users can select which infrastructure they would like to launch. It will launch all the infrastructure in seconds. Docker Compose is the tool I used to run multiple containers as a single service. 
So if somehow website crashes or infrastructure damages, this project can launch all the infrastructure in one click.
